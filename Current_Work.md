# Current Work: Phase 4 Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

## OneLake-Focused Data Structure Implementation

We have successfully completed Phase 4 of the implementation plan, which focused on aligning output with Microsoft Fabric OneLake conventions. The implementation consists of the following changes:

### 1. OneLake Utilities (`fabric_api/onelake_utils.py`)

Created a dedicated module for OneLake integration with:

- **Path Construction**: Functions to build ABFSS paths for OneLake to ensure direct access
- **Table Naming**: Consistent naming conventions for tables (connectwise.entity_name)
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Entity-specific partitioning strategies for improved performance
- **Date-based Partitioning**: Year/month partitioning for time-series data
- **Direct ETL**: Streamlined ETL process with minimal data movement

### 2. Enhanced Delta Utilities (`fabric_api/delta_utils.py`)

Updated the delta_utils module to integrate with OneLake:

- **OneLake Integration**: Updated functions to use OneLake utilities when available
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Maintained backwards compatibility for non-OneLake environments
- **Enhanced DataFrame Preparation**: Added entity-specific optimization for Fabric

### 3. Updated Orchestration (`fabric_api/orchestration.py`)

Enhanced the orchestration module with OneLake-specific features:

- **Fabric-Optimized SparkSession**: Configured SparkSession with Fabric optimizations
- **OneLake Database Initialization**: Automatic creation of connectwise database
- **Entity-Specific Partitioning**: Used OneLake partitioning strategy for each entity
- **New run_onelake_etl Function**: Simple interface for Fabric notebooks

### 4. Sample Fabric Notebook (`fabric_etl_notebook.ipynb`)

Created a sample notebook showing how to use the modernized pipeline in Microsoft Fabric:

- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use functions for both full and incremental loads
- **Key Vault Integration**: Secure handling of credentials
- **SQL Queries**: Examples of querying the loaded data
- **Fabric Compatibility**: Optimized for the Fabric Spark runtime

### 5. Removal of Unnecessary Data Movement

Eliminated unnecessary intermediate steps:

- **Direct Delta Writes**: Writing directly to Delta tables instead of intermediate formats
- **Schema Management**: Automatic schema evolution handling
- **Optimized Validation**: Validation integrated into the write process
- **Simplified Path Management**: Consistent path construction for all entities

### Final Improvements Made

We have completed the final enhancements to the bronze_loader.py module:

1. **Enhanced `process_entity` Function**: Updated to use the new metadata functions for better tracking in Fabric
2. **Improved `write_validation_errors` Function**: Enhanced with proper metadata columns and Fabric path resolution
3. **Optimized `write_to_delta` Function**: Removed duplication with metadata handling and simplified table registration
4. **Updated Example Notebook Usage**: Provided comprehensive examples for incremental loading with date filtering

### Next Steps

The implementation is now complete and ready for testing in a Microsoft Fabric environment. The key improvements are:

1. **Direct OneLake Integration**: Data is written directly to OneLake with proper paths and naming
2. **Consistent Table Structure**: Standardized table naming and structure across entities
3. **Optimized Performance**: Efficient data movement with Fabric-specific optimizations
4. **Simplified API**: Easy-to-use interface for Fabric notebooks and scripts
5. **Enhanced Metadata**: Standardized metadata columns for better data lineage tracking
6. **Improved Error Handling**: Centralized validation error tracking in a dedicated Delta table

The project is ready to move to Phase 5: Implementation Strategy and Next Steps.

## Testing

The implementation includes a test file (`test_onelake_utils.py`) to verify the OneLake utilities functionality.

## Usage

To use the OneLake-focused pipeline in a Fabric notebook:

```python
from fabric_api.orchestration import run_onelake_etl

# Run a full ETL process
table_paths = run_onelake_etl(
    mode="append",     # Use append or overwrite
    max_pages=100      # Limit the number of pages (optional)
)

# Or run an incremental ETL process
incremental_results = run_onelake_etl(
    start_date="2025-04-01",  # Start date for incremental load
    end_date="2025-04-30",    # End date for incremental load
    mode="append"             # Always use append for incremental
)
```

This provides a simple, clean interface for running the ETL pipeline directly in Microsoft Fabric.
